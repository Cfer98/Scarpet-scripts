This file contains additional info about all the math behind the loft script.



Since the script is based on parametric curves and parametric surfaces, let's first define what are those:
a parametric curve is a function that returns a point in 3D space given 1 variable u.
a parametric surface is a function that returns a point in a 3D space given 2 variables (u,v).
